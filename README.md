## How to Clone the Repository to Your Machine

### Step 1: Create a Folder for Your Project

Create a new folder where you want to store your project files.

### Step 2: Copy the Repository's HTTPS URL

You can find the URL by clicking the green "<> Code" button on the repository page.

### Step 3: Open a Terminal in Visual Studio Code

Run the following command in the terminal and press Enter. Note that the period at the end of the command indicates that the files should be copied into the current directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ADAMHUMPHRIES-123/SwoodDocs.git .
```

### Step 4: Install the Required Modules

Run the following command to install the necessary modules:

```sh
npm install
```

## Create Your Development Branch

After cloning the repository, create a new development branch to work on. This helps keep your changes organized and allows for better collaboration. Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Replace `your-branch-name` with a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feature/new-report-module` or `fix/bug-123`). This will create and switch to a new branch where you can make your changes.

```sh
npm run dev
```
